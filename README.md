### Scenario

In a forum, users didn't know how to do basic things in the platform. They wanted some step-by-step tutorials.

### Solution

A section at help page suggestively named "Tutorials" that provides a step-by-step tutorial with a title, a description and an image on each step.

### Warning

Before taking a look at the code, be aware that this code stinks in a way that no one would like to ever touch it.
